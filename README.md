Netflix Clone Landing Page
Project Overview
This project is a front-end clone of the Netflix landing page, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It replicates the core features of the Netflix website, including a responsive design, email signup form, FAQ accordion, and language selector. The project is designed to be visually similar to the Netflix South Africa landing page, with a focus on user interaction and accessibility.
Features

Responsive Design: Adapts to various screen sizes using CSS media queries and flexible layouts.
Email Signup Form: Validates user email input and provides feedback with success/error messages.
FAQ Accordion: Interactive FAQ section with smooth animations and keyboard accessibility.
Language Selector: Basic language switching functionality with content updates (English and placeholder "Other" language).
Profile Management: A profile page for editing user details, including profile picture upload (placeholder functionality).
Sign-in Page: A dedicated sign-in page with email validation and forgot password link.

Installation

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/netflix-clone.git


Navigate to the project directory:cd netflix-clone


Open index.html in a web browser to view the landing page. No server setup is required as the project uses static files.

Usage

Landing Page (index.html): Displays the main Netflix landing page with a signup form, feature sections, and FAQ accordion.
Sign-in Page (signin.html): Allows users to sign in with email validation.
Profile Page (profile.html): Provides a basic interface for editing user profile details.
Interactivity:
Click FAQ questions to expand/collapse answers.
Enter an email in the signup form to test validation (no backend processing).
Change the language in the dropdown to see button text updates (limited to English and a placeholder language).


Accessibility: FAQ questions are keyboard-navigable (use Enter or Space to toggle).

Technologies Used

HTML5: Structure of the web pages.
CSS3: Styling with a custom Netflix-like theme, including gradients and responsive design.
JavaScript: Handles form validation, FAQ accordion, and language selection functionality.
External Resources:
Poppins font (via Google Fonts, assumed to be linked in HTML).
Background image for the header (included in the images folder).



Development Notes

The project is purely front-end and does not include backend functionality for actual user authentication or data storage.
The language selector currently supports English and a placeholder "Other" language (Spanish translations as an example).
Form submissions are simulated with a mock API call (1-second delay) for demonstration purposes.
The profile picture upload is a placeholder and does not process actual file uploads.

Future Improvements

Add backend integration for user authentication and profile management.
Expand language support with more translations and dynamic content loading.
Implement mobile-specific optimizations for better performance.
Add unit tests for JavaScript functionality.
Enhance accessibility with ARIA labels and screen reader support.
